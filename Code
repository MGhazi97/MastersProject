Some data cleaning

```

Ages and their distributions
```{r}

Sex and their count
```{r}
#Using the population data:
tally(~Sex, data = basicData) #This tells us that out of the 7390 flights to Tampa, 6675 had an arrival delay less than 52 mins.
tally(~Sex, data = basicData, format = "proportion") # Converted to percentage

```

Year of death and their count

```{r}
#Using the population data:
tally(~basicData[3], data = basicData) #This tells us that out of the 7390 flights to Tampa, 6675 had an arrival delay less than 52 mins.
tally(~basicData[3], data = basicData, format = "proportion") # Converted to percentage
```


Age per sex
```{r}
males <- basicData %>% filter(Sex == 1)

malesAge <- males %>% count(males[1]); malesAge

females <- basicData %>% filter(Sex == 2)

femalesAge <- females %>% count(females[1]); femalesAge
```
